# A Bitcoin network visualization
Hi! I'm a single page client side visualization of Bitcoin transactions using Chain.com's API and D3. I'm here to be branched and forked.

Check out a live version at http://ideobitcoin.heroku.com.

I'm built as a Heroku Node.js app so I can be pushed to Heroku or run locally using foreman. Send questions, feedback, and thoughts to rwilliams@ideo.com.
